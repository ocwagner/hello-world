Intro to GitHub for ST 558
Hello ST_558 classmates!

I'm ocwagner, a grad student in NC State's Bio and Ag Engineering Department. This is my last class before my degree, which if all goes well, I'll wrap up before I turn 40! Agriculture is becoming more data driven and I want to be part of that conversation, hence my enrollment in this course.
